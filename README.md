### Highlights

**2023** -- The extension updates to Privacy Pass Protocol draft 16, with the cryptographic part in a dedicated library [cloudflare/privacypass-ts](https://github.com/cloudflare/privacypass-ts). Introducing the notion of Attesters and Issuers.

**2022** -- The Privacy Pass protocol can also use RSA blind signatures.

**2021** -- In this [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-pass-v3), we announced the [v3](https://github.com/cloudflare/pp-browser-extension/tree/v3.0.0) version of this extension, which makes the code base more resilient, extensible, and maintainable.

**2020** -- The CFRG (part of IRTF/IETF) started a [working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/privacypass/about/) seeking for the standardization of the Privacy Pass protocol.

**2019** -- The CAPTCHA provider [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy-pass) announced support for Privacy Pass, and the [v2](https://github.com/cloudflare/pp-browser-extension/tree/2.0.0) version was released.

**2018** -- The Privacy Pass protocol is based on a _Verifiable, Oblivious Pseudorandom Function_ (VOPRF) first established by [Jarecki et al. 2014](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/650.pdf). The details of the protocol were published at [PoPETS 2018](https://doi.org/10.1515/popets-2018-0026) paper authored by Alex Davidson, Ian Goldberg, Nick Sullivan, George Tankersley, and Filippo Valsorda. Its homepage is still available at [https://privacypass.github.io](https://privacypass.github.io/).

#### Acknowledgements

## FAQs

#### As a user, how can I add new attestation methods

Depending on your browser settings, the local storage of your browser may be cleared when it is restarted. Privacy Pass stores passes in local storage and so these will also be cleared. This behavior may also be observed if you clear out the cache of your browser.

#### My website support Privacy Pass authentication scheme, but the extension does nothing

This can be an issuer issue, or a Chrome issue. In the later case, make sure you implement a [client replay on your website](#chrome-support-via-client-replay-api).

#### As a service operator, how to roll out out my own attestation method

Privacy Pass does not propose a standard attester API. This extension relies on attester to implement the [cloudflare/pp-attester](https://github.com/cloudflare/pp-attester) API.

If you have such an attester, you should ask your user to update their attesters in the extension options. The attester order matters, first one has a higher priority than the second.

---

## Known Issues

#### Extensions that modify user-agent or headers

There is a [conflict resolution](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/webRequest/#conflict-resolution) happening when more than one extension tries to modify the headers of a request. According to documentation, the more recent installed extension is the one that can update headers, while others will fail.

Compounded to that, Cloudflare will ignore clearance cookies when the user-agent request does not match the one used when obtaining the cookie.

## Chrome support via Client replay API

### Overview

Chrome does not allow extensions to block a request and perform another action, such as completing an attestation flow. To this extent, the extension enables websites to orchestrate a client side replay as defined below.

### Requirements

Your website fetches subressources with JavaScript. If your server returns a challenge on the main frame, the extension automatically refreshes the page without any action needed from your side.

### System definition

On every request, the extension adds header `Private-Token-Client-Replay: <requestID>`. `requestID` is a UUID identifying your next replay attempt.
For resources you know need to be replayed because they contain a `WWW-Authenticate: PrivateToken ...` header, you are going to use this `requestID` to query the extension on the state of the associated token retrieval. Once the extension has retrieved the token, you can replay the request.

Given a `requestID`, you can query `https://no-reply.private-token.research.cloudflare.com/requestID/<requestID>`. The domain `no-reply.private-token.research.cloudflare.com` [does not resolve](https://dnsviz.net/d/no-reply.private-token.research.cloudflare.com/dnssec/) to an IP address, and is captured by the browser extension for replay purposes. Its reply is always going to be a redirect to a ["data" URL](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397#section-2) of the form `data:text/plain,<status>`.

**`GET /requestID/<requestID>`**
* Response URL: `data:text/plain,<status>`
* `status` is `pending`, `fulfilled`, `not-found`

Your website should do the following depending on the returned `status`:
* if `pending`, wait and query `/requestID/<requestID>` again in the future
* if `fulfilled`, replay the initial request
* if `not-found`, cancel the initial request

A sequence diagram illustrate the flow below

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant E as Client
	participant O as Origin
	participant B as Extension
	
	E->>O: GET example.com/img.png
	O->>B: WWW-Authenticate: challenge=[x]
	Note over B: Cannot block request
	B->>B: Adds "Private-Token-Client-Replay: requestID"
	B->>E: 401 Unauthorized + "Private-Token-Client-Replay: requestID"
	par Extension fetches token
        Note over B: Interact with Attester to retrieve Token [x]
	and Client wait
        E->>E: Check "Private-Token-Client-Replay" header
        E->>B: GET /requestID/<requestID>
        B->>E: "200 data:text/plain,pending"
	end
    B->>E: "200 data:text/plain,fulfilled"
    Note over E: Extension is ready to query the Origin
    Note over B: Extension is intercepting request to example.com
    E->>B: GET example.com/img.png
	B->>O: GET example.com/img.png + Authorization [x]
	O->>E: <data>Cat Picture</data>
```

### Design considerations

The proposed replay mechanism has been contrained by [Chrome API reference](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/), specifically the [declarativeNetRequest API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/).

Specifically, the following choices have been engineered as follow
* Use a dedicated replay domain to allow any website to query the extension without hardcoding its ID
* Use a dedicated replay domain that does not resolve to prevent DoS risks, and ensure there are no traffic interception with a faulty extension
* Have every parameter, namely `requestID` be part of the URL to allow for a synchronous response from the extension, headers not being available on every event
* Redirect to a ["data" URL](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397#section-2) to prevent DNS resolution and other extensions interference
* Return `Private-Token-Client-Replay: <requestID>` on every request due to the inability to dynamically append headers to responses in MV3
* Use a pull based method to ease implementation on the extension and origin side
